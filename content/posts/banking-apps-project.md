[The banking apps project](https://privsec.dev/banking) is a maintained list of tested banking apps that do not enforce [SafetyNet](https://grapheneos.org/articles/attestation-compatibility-guide) and work with [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/)'s [compatibility layer](https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play).

Users are able to view the [list](https://privsec.dev/banking) of currently submitted [reports](https://github.com/PrivSec-dev/banking-apps-compat-report/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for banking apps that work on [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).    

Users may also submit a report of the banking app they tested, what features work and which don't. 
An issue form template was created via this projects issue tracker by [Zanthed](https://github.com/Zanthed) (Thanks)
