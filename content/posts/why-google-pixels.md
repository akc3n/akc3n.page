> Why do I need to buy Google hardware when I'm trying to get away from Google!

The reason why Pixel phones are the only supported devices is because they are
- the most secure
- the only handset that allows non-vendor operating systems to use all the handset's hardware security features
- the only handsets whose vendors fully open source drivers
- allowing for firmware source code availibilty to people who ask for it
- the only vendors that are diligent with security updates and upstream those updates!

Most OEMs are far less trustworthy than Google! OEMs cut corners on security and mislead users about it. That's a problem. Doing better than Pixels is very hard.

They have the Titan security chip, insider access protection, and every single driver on the Pixels is open source.

The firmware for them is actually available, if you ask nicely enough. 
It's just not _"open"_. Nor is it modifiable, because the firmware packages are signed and verified.

Other vendors simply do not do this, or they instead cripple the phones hardware security features if you want to run an operating system that doesn't come from that vendor.

Making a device with comparable privacy/security is extremely difficult. It's not something that most companies are interested in doing when they can just market their products as better without doing the work. Why invest a massive amount of resources?

Unfortunately, marketing is what matters to vast majority of people buying products based on "privacy/security". Journalists and others repeat the marketing claims of companies without skepticism of fact checking. Most 'secure' and 'private' phones, OSes, etc. are worse not better.
