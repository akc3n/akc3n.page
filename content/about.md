> _**I'm just an ordinary human that loves to learn, solve puzzles, and eat food.**_   

I spend a lot of time on the internet trying to *dig past all the misleading and/or dishonest marketing nonsense that mainstream news media outlets and 'technical' blogs making claims on security and privacy topics*. The misinformation is often misinterpreted by the vast majority, leading to more problems then solutions in today's society.

I decided to gather and collect as much in depth educational knowledge and technical facts from developers and security research professionals in the open-source community.   

The purpose of my website is to have a place where I can layout my notes while presenting my findings in a structured and organized format; providing citations and resources at the same time. This also enables me to have quick accessibility, the ability to easily share the information during discussions on topics being covered in real-time, and to streamline my personal development growth in the subjects that I'm passionate about.
