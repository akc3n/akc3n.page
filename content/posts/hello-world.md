Welcome to my personal page, where you will find streamlined collections of information from multiple platforms related to GrapheneOS and things I'm passionate about.

I spend a lot of time on the internet trying to dig past all the misleading
and/or dishonest marketing nonsense that mainstream news media outlets and
‘technical’ blogs making claims on security and privacy topics. The the misinformation is then never challenged by the vast majority, leading to more
problems then solutions in today’s society.

I spend a lot of time on the internet trying to dig past all the misleading and/or dishonest marketing nonsense that mainstream news media outlets and ‘technical’ blogs making claims on security and privacy topics. The misinformation is often misinterpreted by the vast majority, leading to more problems then solutions in today’s society.

I decided to gather and collect as much in depth educational knowledge and technical facts from developers and security research professionals in the open-source community.

## The purpose of this site

The purpose of my website is to have a place where I can layout my notes while presenting my findings in a structured and organized format; providing citations and resources at the same time. This also allows me to have easier access to and more easily share the information during discussions on topics being covered in real-time, and to streamline my personal development growth in the subjects that I’m passionate about.

There will also be quite a bit of streamlined information on here that will not be my own writing, but instead direct copy and pastes with credited quotes and citations to important announcements and explanations from multiple platforms, related to GrapheneOS.
